    %distance by integrating sine wave function with respect to 
    %distance covered.
    %   Inputs:
    %       c1  - Tyre circumference (m)
    %       c2  - Front-chainring circumference (teeth)
    %       c3  - Rear-sprocket circumference (teeth)
    %       cad - Cadence (rpm)
    %       A   - Amplitude of path due to lean (m)
    %       D   - Straight-line distance from point A to B (m)
    %   Outputs:
    %       pd  - Percentage diff. between new path length and D
    %       L   - New path length (m)
    %       v   - Velocity travelled (m/s)
    %       dT  - Time penalty compared to D (s)
